# Miscellaneous Smash Hit Modding Tools

> **Warning**
>
> The old Tcl/Tk based tweak tool has been **deprecated** and we now recommend the built-in tool from [Shatter](https://github.com/Shatter-Team/Shatter). If you can't run Shatter for some reason, the new tweak tool is also usable as a command line program!

This repo contains tools for modding Smash Hit that do not really need their own repo but do need to be easily accessable and widely used.
